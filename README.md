```

## NFTExtension
- Can be added to main NFT using `addExtension`
- Support changing mint and tokenURI functions

## How to use:

### Init

```bash
npm i
touch .mnemonic
node scripts/generate_mnemonic.mjs
vim .mnemonic # input generated mnemonic

cp .env.example .env
vim .env # input your keys
```

### Development

When you change something, run:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

Then, to test your code:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Checking different versions of ERC721CommunityImplementation:

```bash
colordiff contracts/ERC721CommunityBase.sol contracts/ERC721CommunityImplementation.sol --context=1
colordiff contracts/ERC721CommunityBase_ERC1155.sol contracts/ERC721CommunityBase.sol --context=1
```

### Deploy to production

You can deploy using Hardhat. Refer to Hardhat scripts and console guides for deployment.
https://hardhat.org/guides/deploying.html

However, we also support deploying with your Metamask:

### Upload to IPFS for Frontend Deploy

Instead of deploying from your local machine, you can compile and send it for deployment from  the Buildship web app.

```bash
hh upload contracts/Greeter.sol --args '"hello","bar"'
```

It needs network selection to run, but it doesn't matter which you use. You can run with development network.
